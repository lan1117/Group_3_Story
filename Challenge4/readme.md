This is a folder for EC544 Challenge4.

demo1.ino is used as Particle application. It is flashed in our 4 photons, so that we can get temperatures and publish them to Particle cloud.

thingspeak.md stores write API key, read API key, and channel that we use for storing data from 4 photons. We setted the channel as private.

particle.zip contains every file that we used to run this challenge.
