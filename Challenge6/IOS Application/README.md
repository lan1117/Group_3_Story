This is IOS application for challenge6.

We use swift and xcode to build this.

Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast.

Xcode is an integrated development environment (IDE) containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for macOS, iOS, WatchOS and tvOS. First released in 2003, the latest stable release is version 8 and is available via the Mac App Store free of charge for OS X El Capitan and macOS Sierra users.
