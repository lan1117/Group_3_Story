Challenge5 -- Steering the Car

In this challenge, we have designed a program to let the crawler runs in a straight line without hitting the wall.

Photon is used as main controller chip.
Lidarlite is used to left/right distance between the car and the wall.
Sonar is used to detect barrier in front of the car.
Rotary Encoder is used to calculate wheel speed.

PID controlling method is implemented in program to adjust turning angle of wheels.

On server side, we designed a IOS application as well as a web site to get data from particle cloud and send speed control command back to photon.

Description

IOSApplication folder includes source codes and other resources of our remote car control application.

Lidar folder includes source code that we used to get distance using lidar.

Speed folder is one of the website template that we planned to use as the web server.

webServer folder includes files and details we finally used as our website.
